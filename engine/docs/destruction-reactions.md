# Destruction reactions

Agreed with the user on 2026-10-25. One strike, blast or collapse can produce every reaction a
real structure shows, and each is decided by the engine and reported as an event:

| # | Reaction | Decided by | Event |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Crushed**: the chunk's material is comminuted and it stops being a rigid chunk | Compressive overstress of the chunk, integrated to damage | `ChunkCrushed` |
| 2 | **Knocked off**: bonds break under the contact or impact force | Threshold predictor / breaks (exists) | `BondsBroken`, `Split` |
| 3 | **Blast loading**: overpressure on exposed faces | Friedlander face pressures (oracle `loads.rs`), now in `World` | the breaks it causes |
| 4 | **Support loss**: the weight left without a load path breaks bonds, pieces tip | `support_loss.rs` load flow and tipping | `BondsBroken`, `Split` |
| 5 | **Dynamic amplification** of a sudden loss | explicit, opt-in | — |
| 6 | **Debris loads** on the structure below | contact-to-load path (exists) | — |

Rubble decides and reports; the host draws dust. Simulating dust particles is optional.

## Rules every part follows

- **Forward-only** (AGENTS.md): a strike's crushes are predicted with its breaks at the end of the
  frame before it and applied before the engine steps. No rewind, no re-solve.
- **Capability flags.** Each reaction is an opt-in switch (`SolverConfig`, `Methods`,
  `SimFeatures` or the `DestructibleDef`), off by default so every existing golden and digest is
  unchanged. Not part of `blast_parity`.
- **No silent defaults.** A crush-enabled material without crush parameters is an error, never a
  guessed value.
- **No lossy surprises.** A crushed chunk's mass is **conserved by default**: it leaves the
  structure as a few small rigid fragments carrying its mass and momentum, so its weight still
  loads the floor below. Removing the mass entirely (dust) is an explicit `CrushMass::Remove`.
- **Energy.** The impactor pays the crush energy (`dD · crushEnergy · V`) out of its kinetic
  energy, before the step, as `J = M (v − sqrt(v² − 2 dE / M))`, capped at `M v` (it can stop a
  striker, never bounce it).

## 1. Chunk crushing

The model is the one PhysX's Blast stress extension and vibe-land ship
(`extStressCrushStep`; PhysX `blast/blast-stress-solver/docs/chunk-crushing.md`), written fresh
for rubble:

```
sigma = (1/V) sum sym(branch (x) force)      contact and bond tractions, no body forces
p = -tr(sigma)/3 (compression positive)      q = sqrt(1.5 s:s)
crushing needs p > 0
excess = max(q - (cohesion + frictionSlope p), p - capPressure)
D += excess^2 dt / (crushViscosity crushEnergy)       crushed at D >= 1
```

Material parameters are per material (`crush` block), derived from the material's own
compressive strength with cited sources (vibe-land `structures/town-kit/src/materials.mjs`
`CRUSH`: EN 1996-1-1, EN 1992-1-1, Bond 1961 comminution energy, CEB-FIP MC90 rate factor).

`ChunkCrushed { destructible, chunk, mass, volume, pose, linear_velocity (at the chunk),
angular_velocity, peak_pressure, peak_deviator, cause: Impact | Blast | Contact | Load }`.

## Tests and oracle

Each part has unit tests from the law's definition and physical invariants (a structure under
its own weight never crushes; tension never crushes; damage is quadratic in overstress; mass and
momentum are conserved in `Conserve`; the impactor's energy drops by the crush energy), and the
crush-wall and reference-building-crush scenes run end to end with every reaction counted.
